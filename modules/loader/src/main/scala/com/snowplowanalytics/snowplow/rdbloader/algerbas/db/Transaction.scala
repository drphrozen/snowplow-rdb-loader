/**
  * An algebra responsible for executing effect `C` (typically coming
  * from [[DAO]], which itself is a pure declaration of the fact that
  * app needs to communicate with a DB) into effect `F`, representing
  * an IO transaction.
  *
  * In other words, multiple `C` effects chained into a single one
  * will be executed within a single `F` transaction. However N
  * chained `F` effects will be executed with N transactions
  *
  * It's important to note that `C` effects can be not only [[DAO]],
  * but also have other interpreters. And those effects do not have
  * transactional semantics

    * directions.
    *
    * This function has following issues (and thus should be used cautionsly):
    * 1. If we downcasted `Logging[F]` into `Logging[C]` and then ran
    *    it through `transact` it means that a connection will be allocated
    *    for that action, but it doesn't really require it
    * 2. Downcasted actions do not have transactional semantics as usual `DAO[C]`
