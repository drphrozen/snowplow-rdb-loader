/**
 * Primary state of the loader
 * Every Loader's action has two input parameters: message and current state
 * The state is used to exchange data between data discovery stream and load actions
 *
 * @param loading state of the folder loading, which can be either idling ("not busy" or
 *        "no folder") or loading at some stage
 * @param updated when the state was updated the last time
 *        Used to find out about degraded infra - if state is not updated for long enough
 *        it likely means that the database is unresponsive
 * @param attempts amount of attempts the Loader took to load **current** folder
 *                 zero'ed after every message ack'ed
 * @param loaded amount of folders the loader managed to load
 * @param messages total amount of message received
